//# Goals: the current webpage has a input box which I was thinking maybe able to input the 22 input features 
//# seperated by a comma (but the character input limit may need to be increased & maybe the input box width) & then 
//# parsed with the comma as the delimiter & then put into an array or list and then inputed in to our model. Then the models out put
//# could be displayed under the column Labeled "Prediction". 
//# (this maybe easier then creating 22 input boxes ?)

//# Currently the input box accepts a string of characters from the user & once the "Predict Heart Disease" button is clicked it adds the string 
//# to a column Labeled "Prediction" of a displayed table 
//# there are currently two other columns to the right of "Prediction" in the table Labeled "Added"	"Actions"

//# Extra(not required): If the above functionality is finished then I would like to maybe change the column labeled "Added" to read "Input Features" & 
//# display the inputed features below this label 

//# Website files & folders include: "app.py", "__pycache__", "static", "templates", "requirements.txt", "website Read me", "test.db"

//# I was not able to upload virtualenv folder (git said it's too big) I had named "workenv" but that is just a team development file so 
//# probably don't need it & it can be recreated with the commands I listed bellow
